Effect: At the beginning of the game before setup select one special order for every turn of the game, then write them down as a list of special orders numbered from &quot;1 to #&quot; with &quot;#&quot; equaling the maximum number of turns you think the game can last. You cannot choose the same special order two turns in a row. Vessels with this special rule roll 3D6 when attempting to go on the special order you had selected for the current game turn, discarding the highest result. Furthermore, if you have already failed a command check this turn any vessels with this special rule which have yet to move may still attempt to go on the special order you chose for the current game turn.</description>

                          <description>**Prerequisite**: Each of your commanders must be given the Empowered Mark of Slaanesh at the cost of sacrificing 1 of their commander’s re-rolls to the lord of excess.

**Effects:** Any of your legion capital ships may take the Mark of Slaanesh for +15 points. In addition to its normal effects Any ships with the Mark of Slaanesh gain the following effects: 
- Veil of Lust: The dissonant noise becomes so palpable, even the sensors and auguries of enemy vessels are affected. Ships firing on this vessel within 30cm must perform a leadership test. If the test is failed then they must re-roll to-hit rolls with a result of &quot;6&quot;. Simply pick up the missed dice and roll them again - the second result stands, even if it is worse. 
- Sirens Song: Vivid sounds and images of unspeakably dark pleasures permeate the hulls of enemy vessels and enrapt entire crews to inaction.While within 15 cm of the marked vessel, enemy ships roll 3D6 for command checks discarding the lowest result. (Note: This supercedes other abilities which affect the number of dice rolled for command checks.)</description>

                      <description>Whenever a vessel with this special rule fires its weapon batteries and bombardment cannons together, add both weapons’ firepower together and look up the corresponding number of to-hit rolls on the gunnery table. Any of these in excess of the bombardment cannons’ firepower are first made by the weapon batteries, and the rest are then made by the bombardment cannons. (ex: When a Strike Cruiser targets a closing capital ship at 30cm range with both its prow bombardment cannon ( firepower 3) and starboard weapons batteries (firepower 4) it would ordinarily roll 2 to-hit rolls for its bombardment cannons and 3 to-hit rolls for its weapons batteries. When an Iron Warriors Strike Cruiser does this you instead combine the firepower values of both weapons into a single firepower 7 attack before consulting the gunnery table resulting in a 5 to-hit roll attack. You then subtract the firepower of the bombardment cannons being used in the attack to determine how many to-hit rolls are made by the weapon batteries. In this example the Iron Warriors Strike Cruiser’s prow bombardment cannon has a firepower of 3, so the first 2 to-hit rolls are made by the weapon batteries and then the remaining 3 to-hit rolls are made by the bombardment cannons.)</description>

Note: This does not apply to Hit-and-Run attacks. (ex: When an Iron Warriors Cobra Class Destroyer targets an enemy vessel with its weapons batteries and torpedoes it does not get to re-roll rolls with a result of 1 to cause critical damage for any hits inflicted by its weapon batteries, however, it does get to re-roll rolls with a result of 1 to cause critical damage for any hits inflicted by its torpedoes. When an Iron Warriors Cruiser with Turbo Weapons targets an enemy vessel with its weapons batteries and torpedoes it gets to re-roll rolls with a result of 1 to cause critical damage for any hits inflicted by its weapon batteries and its torpedoes.)</description>

                          <description>**Prerequisite:** At least half of your capital ships must have been given the reinforced hull refit.
**Iron Within** 
The ordnance strength, gunnery firepower, turrets, and shields values of a vessel with this special rule that is crippled or on Brace for Impact! special orders are reduced 
by only 25% (rounding up) rather than halved. 
**Iron Without** 
*The IV legion typically added many additional layers of ablative (one might even say redundant) armor plating to their vessels.* 
When a vessel with this special rule and the reinforced hull refit suffers a Prow Armament Damaged critical hit it must perform a leadership test. If the test is passed then 
the critical hit is ignored.</description>

                      <description>No Prey Escapes special orders can be undertaken ANY time an enemy ship moves within 15cm inside the front arc of a vessel with this special rule. 


A ship is placed on No Prey Escapes orders until the end of its next turn, replacing any other special order it may be on currently. However, a vessel that goes on No Prey Escapes while on Reload Ordnance orders is still reloaded normally. 


A ship which uses this special order may not use special orders at all in its next turn and its Firepower, ordnance (this effect is cumulative if a capital ship is crippled) and armament Strength is halved, while Nova Cannons and Plasma Scourers may not be fired at all. Turrets and shields are unaffected. 


A ship using No Prey Escapes orders must turn towards the enemy ship and move 4D6 cm forwards as if it were on All Ahead Full orders. If any part of the vessel on No Prey Escapes special orders base contacts any part of the target’s base during the course of its movement it stops even if it has not moved its full distance and initiates a Boarding Action. If this happens the target vessel immediately stops moving even if it has not moved its minimum move distance. If the vessel going on No Prey Escapes special orders is a member of a squadron only one roll is made and every ship in the squadron moves the distance rolled.</description>

**Deeds Worthy of Song** 
After a capital ship with this special rule passes its command check to go on special orders you can declare that it is using one of the sagas from the table to the right. In addition to the normal effects of the chosen special order the ship gains the effect for its chosen saga. 
 
Each saga can only be used once during the battle and no ship may use more than one saga. 


- *Saga of the Void Whale*:  Once per game when going on Brace For Impact! orders announce you&apos;re using Saga of The Void Whale. At the beginning of your next turn take this ship off of Brace For Impact! orders.
- *Saga of the Kraken Slayer*: Once per game when going on Come To New Heading special orders announce that you&apos;re using Saga of the Kraken layer. For the remainder of this turn reduce the distance you need to travel to perform your first turn by 10 cm.
- *Saga of the Thread Cutter*: Once per game when going on Lock On special orders announce that you&apos;re using Saga of the Thread Cutter. For the remainder of the turn this ship may re-roll failed critical hit rolls.   
- *Saga of the Dread Wolf*: Once per game when going on All Ahead Full special orders announce that you&apos;re using Saga of the Dread Wolf. This ship and any friendly space wolves vessels within 30cm may add +2D6 cm to their speed this turn. 
- *Saga of the Helstorm*: Once per game when going on Reload Ordnance special orders announce that you&apos;re using Saga of the Helstorm. Increase the speed of all ordnance launched by this vessel by 5cm for the remainder of the battle.  
- *Saga of the Patient Hunter*: Once per game when going on Burn Retros special orders announce that you&apos;re using Saga of the Patient Hunter. For the remainder of this ship may fire its weapons as if it were not on Burn Retros orders.</description>

                      <description>When a vessel with this special rule fires Lances or weapons which use the gunnery table increase the number of dice rolled to-hit by one, up to the total strength or firepower values for the weapons being fired listed on that ship&apos;s data sheet. This occurs after applying the reductions to the effectiveness of its weapons for any special orders, critical damage, or being crippled. For gunnery weapons the effect of Adaptive Power Conduits is applied after consulting the gunnery table to determine how many to-hit rolls are rolled for the attack. This effect can never increase the strength or firepower of a weapon beyond the values written on the ship’s data sheet.</description>

                          <description>**Prerequisite:** At least half of the capital ships in your fleet must have an armor rating of 6+.
**Singularity Bomb:** When a vessel with this special rule fires a Nova Cannon, after determining the final location of the Nova Cannon template all vessels and ordnance markers within a 10cm radius measured from the template edge are caught in the singularity bomb’s gravity well. Ordnance markers within the gravity well are moved 2D6cm towards the center of the nova cannon template. Vessels within the gravity well must immediately perform a leadership test as if they were attempting to navigate through an asteroid field, and any vessels that fail to pass the leadership test must move 2D6cm and make a 45º turn towards the center of the nova cannon template. After all vessels and ordnance markers within the gravity well have been moved or have passed their navigation test resolve the damage from the attack normally.
**Graviton-Annihalator:** When a vessel with this special rule fires a Plasma Scourer, in addition to it’s normal effects trace a 1cm wide line from the attacking ship’s base to the target ship’s base. Any vessel touched by this line cannot go on All Ahead Full, Come to New Heading, and Burn Retros special orders and reduces its speed by -5cm during its next turn
**Extremis Arsenal:** Iron Hands Legion capital ships that utilize torpedoes can be equipped with refitted torpedoes as described in their rules on pg. 19. of the BFG:Remastered - Fleets book.</description>

                      <description>When a vessel with this special rule begins its movement, if there is an enemy ship in its front arc within 30cm the ship must perform a free turn towards the nearest enemy vessel (Or a different enemy ship in its front arc within 30cm by passing a target priority test) and attempt to move into base contact with the enemy, at which point it stops even if it has not moved its minimum move distance, and declare a boarding action, if possible. (Note that this does not prevent you from going on special orders, however, vessels that have moved into contact with an enemy ship and initiated a boarding action may not fire their weapons or launch ordnance in the same turn, because their crews are too busy trying to reach the enemy ship.) 
A vessel may attempt to resist the pull of the nails by taking a leadership test on 3D6, discarding the highest result (If there is an enemy ship in its front arc within 15cm roll 2D6 instead). If the test is passed then that vessel proceeds with its turn normally. If the test is failed the ship must attempt to declare a boarding action using the process described above.</description>

                          <description>**Prerequisite:** You must include at least one escort or heavy escort for every three cruisers (of any kind) and for each battleship or battlebarge in your fleet. (e.g. An Ultramarines fleet with 3 cruisers and 1 battleship would need to include 2 escorts or heavy escorts)  
**Effect:**  At the beginning of each of your turns choose one special order to be the fleet order until the beginning of your next turn. When a vessel with this special rule attempts to go on the special order chosen as this turn’s fleet order, roll 3D6 for its command check, discarding the highest result. If the command check is successful it gains the corresponding effect listed below in addition to the normal effects of going on that special order. You may not select the same fleet order two turns in a row.
- **All Ahead Full:** Add +D6 cm to its movement. 
- **Come To New Heading:** Reduce the distance the it needs to move before turning by 5 cm. 
- **Burn Retros:** Its weapons’ effectiveness is reduced by only 25% (rounding up) rather than halved.
- **Lock On:**  It benefits from an extra left column-shift in addition to any other column-shifts that apply for all gunnery weapons.
- **Reload Ordnance:** Re-roll repair rolls with a result of &quot;1&quot;.
- **Brace For Impact!:** Re-roll saving throws with a result of “1”.</description>

They cannot turn 45° in the turn they have launched. They may elect to ignore hulks but must attack the first enemy ship they contact.
Boarding torpedoes attack if they come into contact with an enemy ship&apos;s base. COnduct a Hit-and-run raid against the ship immediately.</characteristic>

Barrage bombs may also be launched in space, like ordinary torpedoes. Each salvo of  arrage bombs which strikes a planet during a planetary assault scenario earns 1 assault point if it is strength 6 or less, 2 assault points if it is strength 7 or greater. Barrage bombs which attack ships do not ignore shields like other ordnance; instead they knock down shields and place blast markers for hits just like a direct fire attack (which can be pretty useful in its own right)</characteristic>

Barrage bombs may also be launched in space, like ordinary torpedoes. Each salvo of  arrage bombs which strikes a planet during a planetary assault scenario earns 1 assault point if it is strength 6 or less, 2 assault points if it is strength 7 or greater. Barrage bombs which attack ships do not ignore shields like other ordnance; instead they knock down shields and place blast markers for hits just like a direct fire attack (which can be pretty useful in its own right)</characteristic>

            <characteristic name="Effects" typeId="fe13-6bab-c5cb-4f1d">Due to their substantial armored prow, Retaliator class grand cruisers ignore all Prow Armament Damaged 
critical hits, rather than suffer the next highest result on the Critical Damage table. However, a Retaliator class grand cruiser armed 
with prow torpedoes automatically loses this special rule, as its prow must be reconfigured to accommodate the torpedo tubes.</characteristic>
